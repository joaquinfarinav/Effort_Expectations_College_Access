Holding high aspirations about the future has been shown to break the persistence of poverty and promote upward social mobility, especially in developing countries. In this article, I examine the role of beliefs held by parents, students, and teachers about students' future educational attainment, in the context of the Chilean educational system. I examine to what extent these expectations can be shaped. Using quasi-experimental evidence from a Chilean policy that provides free tuition for students of the poorest 60% of families in the country, I estimate the causal impact of lowering the total cost of education on college-going expectations held by parents, students, and teachers. Utilizing a longitudinal difference-in-differences model, I consider students from older cohorts, who did not experience the policy during their school life but would have qualified, as a control group. I test whether the policy has differential effects with respect to (i) baseline academic performance, and (ii) rurality/distance to higher education institutions. Several positive and statistically significant estimates show that college-going expectations can be improved at scale (in the sense of more years of education).
