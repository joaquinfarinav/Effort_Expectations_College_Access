College access is extremely inequitable in developing contexts, and financial-only measures are proving not to be enough. Contextualized in Chile, I first document longitudinal multicohort trends of potential non-financial barriers to access to higher education, namely effort and parental expectations. I then examine the impact of an unconditional free college tuition policy targeted at the poorest 60% families on expectations held by parents about the student’s future educational attainment and their exerted effort while in school. I find evidence of large, historically persistent socioeconomic disparities in learning levels, college enrollment, effort, and expectations. Most notably, there is a disproportionately large decrease in academic performance and attendance for lower-income students at the juncture of high school. Additionally, my findings suggest that while the free college tuition policy significantly increased parental expectations for their children’s educational attainment, it did not substantially affect the students’ effort, measured by Grade Point Average (GPA) and attendance. This suggests that while financial aid can influence beliefs about educational attainment, it is insufficient in altering student behavior toward higher academic achievement.
